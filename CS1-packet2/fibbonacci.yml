  The Fibonacci Sequence is a very popular sequence in mathematics, and it's found in nature all the time!
  The Fibonacci formula,
  ![fibonacci formula](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/c/e/0cebc512d9a3ac497eda6f10203f792e.png) with seed values ![seed values](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/2/a92c5f0981136ba333124cdfe6d3c3ce.png), basically means that starting with the numbers `0` and `1`, each number is the sum of the previous two.

  The sequence normally looks like this:

  I was trying to write a program that would give me the `nth` iteration of the Fibonacci sequence, but somebody has corrupted my code!!

  Here is all I could recover:
  ```java
  public stXXXc loXX Fib(long n)
      {
          if(n == XXXX)
              return 0;
          if(n == XXXX)
              return 1;
          elXX
          {
              lXXX num1 = 0, num2 = 1, temp = 0;
              for(XXXX)
              {
                  temp = num2 + num1;
                  num1 = XXXX;
                  num2 = temp;
              }
              return XXXX;
          }
      }
  ```

  Can you fix it? `Hint: research "dynamic fibonacci"`
input: "The input will consist of a single integer `n`, which is the Fibonacci number you must calculate."
output: "The `nth` number in the Fibonacci Sequence"
